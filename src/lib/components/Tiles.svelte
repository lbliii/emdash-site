        <p>Before we start designing a website or app, we create wireframes that outline the structure and layout of each page. Our wireframes help to establish a clear design direction and ensure that all stakeholders are aligned before we begin the full design process. We use a combination of sketches, digital tools, and client feedback to create wireframes that accurately reflect the project's requirements. </p>
